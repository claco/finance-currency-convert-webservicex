NAME
    Finance::Currency::Convert::WebserviceX - Lightweight currency
    conversion using WebserviceX.NET

SYNOPSIS
        use Finance::Currency::Convert::WebserviceX;
        my $cc = Finance::Currency::Convert::WebserviceX->new;
        my $result = $cc->convert(1.95, 'USD', 'JPY');

DESCRIPTION
    This is a lightweight module to do currency conversion using the Curency
    Convertor web service at http://www.webservicex.net/.

    The motivation for this module was many fold. First,
    Finance::Currency::Convert with Finance::Quote was a little too bulky
    for my needs, esp the need to download or maintain conversion tables.
    Finance::Currency::Convert::Yahoo seemed to be based on screen scraping.
    Way to fragile for my taste. Finance::Currency::Convert::XE has usage
    restrictions from XE.com. [No offense intended to any of the authors
    above]
