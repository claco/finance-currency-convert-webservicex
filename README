NAME
    Finance::Currency::Convert::WebserviceX - Lightweight currency
    conversion using WebserviceX.NET

SYNOPSIS
        use Finance::Currency::Convert::WebserviceX;
        my $cc = Finance::Currency::Convert::WebserviceX->new;
        my $result = $cc->convert(1.95, 'USD', 'JPY');

DESCRIPTION
    This is a lightweight module to do currency conversion using the Curency
    Convertor web service at http://www.webservicex.net/.

    The motivation for this module was many fold. First,
    Finance::Currency::Convert with Finance::Quote was a little too bulky
    for my needs, esp the need to download or maintain conversion tables.
    Finance::Currency::Convert::Yahoo seemed to be based on screen scraping.
    Way to fragile for my taste. Finance::Currency::Convert::XE has usage
    restrictions from XE.com. [No offense intended to any of the authors
    above]

CONSTRUCTOR
    You know the routine. "new" is your friend.

        use Finance::Currency::Convert::WebserviceX;
        my $cc = Finance::Currency::Convert::WebserviceX->new;

METHODS
  convert($value, $from, $to)
    Converts a number value from one currency to another and returns the
    result.

        my $result = $cc->convert(1.95, 'USD', 'JPY');

    If an error occurs, no value is given, or the from/to aren't 3 letter
    currency codes, "convert" returns "undef".

    For now, you can access the request response after calling C>convert>:

        my $response = $self->{'response'};

    This returns a HTTP::Response object that can be used to inspect any
    remote web service errors. $self->response{'request'} is reset at the
    beginning of every call to "convert" and returns "undef" otherwise.

    value
        The number or price to be converted.

    from
        The three letter ISO currency code for the currency amount specified
        in "value". See Locale::Currency for the available currency codes.

    to  The three letter ISO currency code for the currency you want the
        "value" to be converted to. See Locale::Currency for the available
        currency codes.
